# Operation Infopredator — Passive Wireless Exposure Study

A controlled academic red-team simulation demonstrating how modern devices communicate automatically after joining a nearby wireless network — even without user interaction and without internet access.

This project focuses on behavioral exposure, not exploitation.

---

## Objective

To study what information a device reveals at the moment of network association.

Most users believe risk begins when they browse or log in.

This experiment shows communication begins earlier.

---

## Key Idea

Connection itself is an active event.

A device does not need to:

* open apps
* visit websites
* enter credentials

to start communicating.

---

## Lab Environment

Closed laboratory setup using only personally owned devices.

No external networks
No real users
No internet connectivity

## Ethical Notice

This project does not demonstrate hacking or exploitation.

It demonstrates default device behavior in a controlled environment for educational purposes only.

---

## What This Project Shows

Modern devices attempt background communication immediately after connection.

Therefore risk begins at association — not interaction.

---

## Author Intent

The goal is awareness.

Understanding how systems behave helps users make informed security decisions.
